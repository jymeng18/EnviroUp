## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EnviroUp.git
   cd EnviroUp
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend**
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Start the Flask server
   cd backend
   python run.py
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`

3. **Set up the Frontend**
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal, navigate to frontend
   cd frontend
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and start exploring!

## How to Use

1. **Search for a location** - Try searching for "Vancouver", "Kamloops", or "British Columbia"
2. **View predictions** - The map will display predicted fire zones with severity levels
3. **Explore details** - Click on markers to see confidence scores and raw data
4. **Learn about risks** - Each prediction includes severity assessment and confidence metrics
5. **Chat with AI** - Use the Gemini AI chatbot to ask questions about wildfires, environmental safety, and climate action


## AI Chatbot

The platform features a **Gemini AI-powered chatbot** that provides:

- **Environmental Education** - Learn about climate change, wildfires, and environmental safety
- **Wildfire Information** - Get answers about fire prevention, safety tips, and emergency procedures
- **Interactive Learning** - Ask questions about sustainable development goals and environmental awareness
- **Real-time Assistance** - Get instant responses to your environmental and safety questions

## Machine Learning

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on real wildfire data from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellites. The model predicts wildfire probability based on:

- Geographic coordinates
- Historical fire patterns
- Environmental factors
- Seasonal data

## Design Inspiration

The visual design and atmosphere are inspired by **Firewatch**, the critically acclaimed indie game by Campo Santo. The game's beautiful art style and environmental storytelling served as the primary inspiration for this project's aesthetic.
